Debugging your scripts
######################

If you'd like to see the details of every request that Artillery is sending, run it like:
::

  DEBUG=http artillery run myscript.yaml


If you'd like to see every response that Artillery receives from the server, run with:
::

  DEBUG=http:response artillery run myscript.yaml

Randomizing requests
####################

Artillery's scenarios have the concept of *variables*, which can be used in strings with ``{{ varName }}`` / ``{{{ varName }}}`` (e.g. in URLs, or POST body payloads). There are three ways to create a variable:

- By capturing part of a response (see "Parsing JSON Responses" below)
- By importing values from external CSV files
- By specifying values inline in the test script

Using CSV files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``config.payload`` can be used to import values from one or more external CSV files:
::

  config:
    # ... Other config here ...
    payload:
      path: "./relative/path/to/mydata.csv"
      fields:
        - "name"
        - "houseNumber"
        - "street"
        - "zipCode"


Here we have defined 4 variables (``name``, ``houseNumber``, ``street``, and ``zipCode``) which would correspond to the fields in the CSV file.

When a virtual user is launched and picks a scenario where these variables are used, a line from the CSV file will be read at random to populate the variables.

To tell Artillery to read the lines in sequence, set ``order`` attribute to ``sequence``:
::

  payload:
    path: "./relative/path/to/mydata.csv"
    fields:
      - "name"
      - "houseNumber"
      - "street"
      - "zipCode"
    order: "sequence"

Using inline variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``config.variables`` can be used to specify variable values inline in the script like so:
::

  config:
    # ... Other config here ...
    variables:
      zipCode:
        - "35801"
        - "99501"
        - "85001"
        - "94203"
        - "90210"


Here we have defined a ``zipCode`` variable which will have the value picked at random from the list when a virtual user executes the scenario where the variable is used.

The variable can be used like so:
::

  config:
    # ... config here ...
  scenarios:
    -
      flow:
        -
          get:
            url: "/zip/{{ zipCode }}"
